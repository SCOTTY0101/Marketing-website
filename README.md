# Marketing-website

Website built using bootstrap and sass.
Bootstrap can be used with CDN (Content Delivery Network) or with NPM (Node Package Manager).
Sass installed with NPM.

Changes to the website style must be made with sass and not the css file!!!!
Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted/compiled into Cascading Style Sheets(css).
